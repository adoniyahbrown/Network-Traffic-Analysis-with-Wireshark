# Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

Network traffic analysis is a crucial skill in cybersecurity. Wireshark is a popular network protocol analyzer used to capture and analyze network traffic. This tutorial will guide you through installing, capturing, and analyzing network traffic using Wireshark.

### Skills Learned

- **Packet Capture and Filtering**: Gained expertise in capturing live network traffic and applying precise filters to isolate specific protocols, IP addresses, and conversations for detailed analysis.
  
- **Protocol Analysis and Troubleshooting**: Developed the ability to dissect and interpret various network protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, DNS, HTTP) to identify abnormal traffic patterns, performance issues, and security threats.
  
- **Traffic Pattern Recognition**: Learned to use Wiresharkâ€™s statistical tools and I/O graphs to detect traffic anomalies, identify potential malicious activity, and troubleshoot network performance bottlenecks.
